# data-buffet
This repository is to speed up data processing process and provide packed data for quick run

We start with some good example repos and learn the best from them
* [sidechainnet](https://github.com/jonathanking/sidechainnet)
* [atom3d](https://github.com/drorlab/atom3d)
* [deepchem](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem)
* [TDC](https://github.com/mims-harvard/TDC)

### Plan:
Dataset class:

* Quiry on data (for user):
  * Raw data.
  * Processed data. [Done]
* Functions to process data (for developer):
  * Convert protein sequence to tokenized sequence. [Done]
  * Conver compound smile to graphs. [Done]
  * Dataset split based on similarity (need to cross-talk).
