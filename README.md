# data-buffet
```dataclasses.py``` contains data classes ```Complex Seq Ang Dist``` 
1. Only based on the dataset, give the angle maps, distance matrices, interacting prot pairs, interacting domain pairs
2. If the user inputs two uniprot ids for the two proteins, first (if the uniprot id pair is found in the dataset), give the evidence complex pdb id, interacting domain pairs on them and further more the corresponding interacting chain pairs in the pdb file; Or (if the uniprot id pair is NOT found in the dataset) give the interacting domains on them.
